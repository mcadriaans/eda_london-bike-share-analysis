Welcome to the London Bike Share Analysis repository. This project aims to analyze bike share data to uncover insights and answer key business questions. The repository includes an interactive Tableau dashboard, a Python notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and a markdown file with SQL business questions and answers.

## What is bike sharing?
Bike sharing is a transportation service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis, typically for a small fee or for free in some cases. It offers a convenient and eco-friendly way to navigate urban areas, providing an alternative to traditional modes of transport like cars and public transit.


## Project Overview
This project explores the London Bike Share dataset from 2015 to 2017. The analysis encompasses data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand bike-sharing usage patterns in London.

## Repository Contents
* Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook (EDA.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, cleaning, and initial analysis.
* Tableau Dashboard: Provides interactive visualizations of bike-sharing data + Guide to navigating the dashboard.
* SQL markdown which documents questions and answers to key business questions about the bike share data.

## Dataset 
*The London bike sharing dataset provides information on bike-sharing activity in London, capturing details such as the number of bike shares, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, holidays, weekends, and meteorological seasons. This dataset helps analyze and understand factors affecting bike-sharing trends and patterns over time.*
